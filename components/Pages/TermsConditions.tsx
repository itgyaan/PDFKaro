          <Section title="1. Acceptance of Terms">
            <p>
              These Terms and Conditions apply to your use of the PDF Karo Android app, the PDF Karo iOS
              app, and the PDF Karo website. By using PDF Karo, you agree to
              these terms.

          </Section>

          <Section title="2. What PDF Karo Provides">
            <p>
              PDF Karo provides tools for common PDF and document workflows, including merging, splitting,

            <p>
              Most document operations are performed locally on your device or in your browser. On Android,
              some platform features use network access, such as Google Play in-app updates and Google Play
              services scanner support. Core processing on iOS does not require a server, and links you choose
              to open may launch a browser.
